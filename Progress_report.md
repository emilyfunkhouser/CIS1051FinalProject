Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I started working through the steps in the articles I found and combining their ideas to create a simple stock tracker to start and expand on. Installed necessary modules. Utilized Google Collab Notebook. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to continue going through some of the steps mentioned in the articles. I also need to modify the code  in order to predict price for more than one stock. Further, I want to make my project more user friendly. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

So far, I have not had any major issues. I had to install some modules in order to access them in the program, and I had to use a Google Collab Notebook in order to do so.
