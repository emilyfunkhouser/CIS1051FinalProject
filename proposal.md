# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Stock Predictor

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A stock price predictor created in Python

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This project will be a simple stock predictor created in Python. The software will use various methods in order to display a graph of the projected price of a stock. I will be trying a few different methods of predicting stock price including using neural networks as specified in this article (https://towardsdatascience.com/simple-stock-price-prediction-with-ml-in-python-learners-guide-to-ml-76896910e2ba). I will also use other methods such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, lasso, etc. as specified in this article (https://dev.to/nitdgplug/stonksmaster-predict-stock-prices-using-python-ml-3hmc). The second article also mentions reading on LTSMs neural nets and trying to implement it as a potential to take the project to the next level. Overall, depending on the success of each model, I may use the best model or display a prediction from a few different models. Potential features other than the basic stock predictor are allowing the user to select which stock to view the price of or allowing the user to select which method of prediction to use for the chart. This will be executed by creating the program in Python which a user can run. Some libraries that may be used in the execution are iexfinance, scikit-learn, TFANN, numpy, Matplotlib, and sykit-learn, which I have seen utilized in the articles specified above. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

1. Retrieve data from iexfinance library or Yahoo Finance. 
2. Display a chart prediction of the projected stock price for at least one stock.
3. Display a chart prediction of the projected movement of the SP500 index as a whole.
4. Utilize at least one method of stock price prediction successfully. 
5. Implement basic machine learning as referenced in the articles specified above. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

1. Display a chart prediction of the projected stock price for the top 5 SP500 stocks by index value. 
2. Utilize a few methods of stock price prediction successfully. 
3. Implement basic machine learning and neural nets. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

1. Display a chart prediction of the projected stock price for the top 10 SP500 stocks by index value. 
2. Allow the user to select which stock to view and which method of prediction to use. 
3. Utilize various methods of stock price prediction successfully. 
4. Research and implement LSTMs neural nets. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

1. Retrieve data from iexfinance library or Yahoo Finance. 
2. Research prediction algorithms (Linear regression, Lasso, Elastic Net, etc.)
3. Research basic information regarding neural nets and machine learning in Python. Research potential ways this could be implemented. 
4. Identify any other prediction algorithms or tools that would be successful in implementing this project.
5. Test models on data and determine which are most accurate.
6. Attempt to implement models with the data that has been retrieved. 
7. Attempt to further research/implement neural nets if time allows. 
8. Finalize project and include additional features if time permits such as allowing the user to select which model to use or which stock out of the top 10 SP500 stocks for which to display data.
