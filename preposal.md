# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

For my final project, I wanted to use python to predict stock prices of a particular stock. This is especially interesting to me since Finance is my major. 

I also found the below article which could be a good place to start/reference: 
https://towardsdatascience.com/simple-stock-price-prediction-with-ml-in-python-learners-guide-to-ml-76896910e2ba

I will most likely try to do this with some of the top stocks in the SP500 index like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, etc. I will also probably use data from Yahoo Finance. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A, will be doing the project alone

## Do you have any questions of your own?

No specific questions at the time.
